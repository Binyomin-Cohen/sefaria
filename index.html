        <p>This application works by finding the 10 words before and after the specified tana/amora, for every reference to that tana/amora in Masekehet Berakhot. The distribution of
        words is then used to generate a "Word Cloud" where the magnitude of each word reflects the relative frequency of that word. This tool is useful for uncovering stylistic differences
        between tanaim/amoraim as well as differences in content. Specifically, more frequently references to "amar" may correspond to a tana/amora who speaks more than asks questions.
        Additionally, the prominence of certain topics will vary from sage to sage.
